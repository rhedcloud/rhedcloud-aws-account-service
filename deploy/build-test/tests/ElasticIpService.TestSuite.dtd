		If a CreateRequest is specified, the TestSuite application will take the

		appropriate reply was returned from the authoritative source. Finally, it
		will verify that the appropriate ExpectedCreateSync message was published by the
		authoritative source.
	
		messageCategory
		
		This will be the fully qualified message category associated 
		with the Create-Request message you would like to send.
		
		messageObjectName
	
		This is the name of the message object. This should match the name given

		NewData
		
		The NewData element consists of the data that should be used to populate

		Since this DTD should import the appropriate resources file for your
		organization, the full message object definitions will be available and 
		assist in constraining and prompting for complete message object data entry.
				
		TestResult
		
		The TestSuiteApplication will use this element as an expected result in 
		verifying the reply sent by the gateway that consumes the Create-Request
		message. See the comments with the TestResult element in this definition.

		The CreateSync element is used to publish a Create-Sync message to a 
		target that processes sync messages.  Then, the optional QueryRequest 
		element can be used to determine if the sync was processed correctly.  Normally, 
		in these situations the Create-Sync will be for a message object that the 
		system IS NOT authoritative for and the QueryRequest will be for a different 
		object that it IS authoritative for.
		
		The 'sleepInterval' attribute indicates how many milliseconds the TestSuite 
		application should wait between publishing the Sync message and performing 
		the Query to verify the sync was processed properly.  All other attributes 
		are used in the same way they are used for the CreateRequest element.
		
		For example, a system may consume BasicPerson-Create-Sync messages 
		to keep it's own store up-to-date.  However, it IS NOT authoritative for BasicPerson
		objects.  However, it is authoritative for some other object that includes some 
		BasicPerson information.  Therefore, it consumes BasicPerson sync messages 
		and when someone queries for the object it is authoritative for, it uses some of 
		that BasicPerson information in that object.

		The NewData element will be used by both CreateRequest and UpdateRequest 
		TestSteps. It will also appear in ExpectedCreateSync and ExpectedUpdateSync expected

		is a required element in these messages.
	
		The objects that are acceptable children of this element will vary based on
		your organization. In other words, the reason you include your organization's
		resources DTD is to include your message object definitions within this

		provides data entry assistance by allowing the author of a test suite to
		fully validate the document and use XML editors that will prompt for message
		object fields during data entry.
	
		In this case, only the message objects of the fictitious enterprise
		any-openeai-enterprise.org can appear in the NewData element (such as

		The status attribute is the status that should be included in the reply
		message that is returned by the authoritative source after it performs the
		action. The TestSuiteApplication can look at this expected status and compare 
		it to the actual status returned by the gateway. If the status returned by
		the gateway does not match the expected value specified here, the TestStep

<!--
		The ExpectedCreateSync element is used to specify the data that should be included 
		in a Create-Sync message published by an authoritative application after it
		successfully processes a Create-Request message. After the TestSuiteApplication 
		produces all the requests, it will consume all sync messages published by 
		the gateway and determine if it published the appropriate messages by
		comparing the expected sync messages to the actual syncs consumed.
	
		The sync messages published are correlated to the requests that precipitated 
		them by the TestId element in the ControlArea of the messages. The TestId is
		a combination of the TestSuite name, TestSeries number, TestCase number, and
		TestStep number.
	
		The Java message objects inherit the TestId member data and corresponding 
		getter/setter methods. When the TestSuite application sends a request, it
		populates the object with the TestId. Then, when the requests are produced, 
		that TestId is placed into the ControlAreaRequest of the message. Then, the 
		gateway that consumes the message should retrieve that TestId and populate 
		any object it uses to publish the sync message with that TestId. In this way,
		the TestId will become part of the ControlAreaSync of the sync message, which 
		can be pulled out by the TestSuiteApplication and used to find the appropriate
		expected sync listed in the TestSuite document with which to compare with the
		actual sync message consumed.-->
<!ELEMENT ExpectedCreateSync (NewData)>
<!--
		The QueryRequest element is used to specify the data that should be used 
		to perform a query action. It also allows entry of the data expected to be 
		returned from that query in the form of the ProvideData element.
		
		producerName
		
		This should only be used if this QueryRequest is being used to validate a sync 
		message was processed properly by the consuming system.  It will contain 
		the name of the PointToPointProducer that the TestSuite application should 
		use to execute the QueryRequest.  This is needed because the Sync message 
		will be published using a PubSubProducer and the QueryRequest needs a 
		PointToPointProducer.
	
		messageCategory
		
		This will be the fully-qualified message category associated with the
		Query-Request message.
		
		queryObjectName
		
		This is the name of the object that should be used as the key object in the
		query. This should match the name of the message object in the 
		TestSuiteApplication's deployment descriptor. It will look for a message
		object with a name that matches the value specified here, populate it with
		the QueryData and pass it to the query method of the message object being
		used to perform the query.
		
		messageObjectName
		
		This is the name of the message object for which the query is being
		performed. This should match the name given to a message object in the 
		TestSuiteApplication's deployment descriptor. It will look for a message
		object with a name that matches the value specified here and use it to
		perform the query.
		
		messageRelease
		
		The messageRelease attribute is the message release number associated with
		the message object.
		
		messagePriority
		
		The messagePriority attribute is the message priority associated with the

		here and passed to the query method of the message object being used to
		perform the query. Like NewData, DeleteData, and BaselineData, the child
		elements that may be listed within QueryData are constrained based on the
		message object definitions included in this definition through the resources
		import above.

		The TestSuiteApplication will use this element as an expected result in 
		verifying the reply sent by the gateway that consumes the Query-Request
		message. See the comments with the TestResult element in this definition.
	
		ProvideData

		The TearDownRequest is used by the TestSuite Application to 
		take the authoritative system back to a known state.  Many 
		times, depending on the TestSteps that are executed, and 
		the success or failure of those steps, it is 
		necessary to do this in order to be able to run the TestSuite 
		multiple times.  This request is typically used after a series of 
		TestSteps have been executed as the last TestStep in a 
		TestCase.
		
		The TearDownRequest instructs the TestSuite application to 
		query for a particular object and use the results of that query 
		to delete everything that gets returned.  This is different than 
		a normal DeleteRequest because you are not specifying the 
		DeleteData to use in the delete as it may not be correct based 
		on the success or failure of previous steps.  This approach 
		allows you to simply say "query for this object and delete 
		whatever is returned, without verifying the results."
		
		This request uses DeleteAction and QueryData just like the 
		DeleteRequest and QueryRequest.  It also uses the
