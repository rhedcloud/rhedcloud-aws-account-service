<!--	Domains.dtd is a file in which any custom datatypes are defined.
		
		The OpenEAI Deployment Patterns suggest that, when using DTDs,
		an enterprise should separate its definitions into four slices
		to improve the management of definitions and to promote the use
		of common object definitions.  The four slices are:
		
		Resources - 	a  file for including definitions from enternal
							organizations.  For examaple, in their own
							Resources.dtd, an enterprise will reference
							the OpenEAI definitions, which give them the
							ControlArea* definitions required by the OpenEAI
							Message Protocol. 
							
		Segments - 	a file where definitions of all elements with
							children appear
							
		Fields - 		a file where all elements without children appear
		
		Domains - 	a file in which any custom datatypes are defined
		
		This approach was learned by observing contraint practices of the 
		Open Application Group, and these same practices have served the
		practitioners of OpenEAI well.
